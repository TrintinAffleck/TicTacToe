# TicTacToe

For those that have never played the game is played on a 3x3 grid with 9 positions.
In my game it is in the same order as a numpad with 789 at the top and 123 at the bottom row.
The game will choose which player starts randomly.
You choose your marker either an X or an O.
Player then chooses where to place their X or O on the grid.
3 X's or 3 O's in a row wins.
